### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True 
    else
      return False
   
# Colon is missing after else
# on line 21, == should be used instead of =

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2

# Wrong spelling of def.
# A comma is missing between card1 and card2 in the parenthesis.
# There should be indentation for if statement.
# Wrong variable is used - should be card1 instead of card.


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total

# A placeholder value should be passed into the variable total, like total = 0
# There should be a space after "of"
# It is better to include the variable total in the string, using f-string.
  
```
